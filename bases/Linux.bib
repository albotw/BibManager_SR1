  abstract =     "Concurrency in the Linux kernel can be a contentious topic. The Linux kernel mailing list features numerous discussions related to consistency models, including those of the more than 30 CPU architectures supported by the kernel and that of the kernel itself. How are Linux programs supposed to behave? Do they behave correctly on exotic hardware? A formal model can help address such questions. Better yet, an executable model allows programmers to experiment with the model to develop their intuition. Thus we offer a model written in the cat language, making it not only formal, but also executable by the herd simulator. We tested our model against hardware and refined it in consultation with maintainers. Finally, we formalised the fundamental law of the Read-Copy-Update synchronisation mechanism, and proved that one of its implementations satisfies this law.",

  abstract =     "As applications and operating systems are becoming more complex, the last decade has seen the rise of many tracing tools all across the software stack. This article presents a hands-on comparison of modern tracers on Linux systems, both in user space and kernel space. The authors implement microbenchmarks that not  only quantify the overhead of different tracers, but also sample fine-grained metrics that unveil insights into the tracers' internals and show the cause of each tracer's overhead. Internal design choices and implementation particularities are discussed, which  helps us to understand the challenges of developing tracers. Furthermore, this analysis aims to help users choose and configure their tracers based on their specific requirements to reduce their overhead and get the most of out of them.",

  abstract =     "Integration of emulation and simulation in virtual time requires that emulated execution bursts be ascribed a duration in virtual time and that emulated execution and simulation executions be coordinated within this common virtual time basis. This article shows how the open-source tool TimeKeeper for coordinating emulations in virtual time can be integrated with three different existing software emulations/simulations (CORE, Mininet, and EMANE) and with two existing network simulators (ns-3 and S3F). The integration does not require modification to those tools. However, the information that TimeKeeper needs to administer these emulations has to be extracted from each. We discuss the issues and challenges we encounter there, and the solutions. The S3F integration is specialized and shows how we can treat bursts of emulated execution just like an event handler in a discrete-event simulation. Through these case studies, we show the impact that the time dilation factor has on available resources, execution time, and fidelity ofcausality and that deleterious behaviors suffered under best-effort management of emulation processes can be corrected by integration with TimeKeeper. The key contribution is that we have shown how, using TimeKeeper, it is possible to bring virtual time to many existing emulators without needing to change them.",

                 requirements of real-time applications, the advent of
                 mixed criticality computing, and the necessity of
                 reducing costs are leading to an increase in the
                 interest for employing COTS hardware in real-time
                 domains. In this scenario, the Linux kernel is emerging
                 as a valuable solution on the software side, thanks to
                 the rich support for hardware devices and peripherals,
                 along with a well-established programming environment.
                 However, Linux has been developed as a general-purpose
                 operating system, followed by several approaches to
                 introduce actual real-time capabilities in the kernel.
                 Among these, the PREEMPT_RT patch, developed by the
                 kernel maintainers, has the goal to increase the
                 predictability and reduce the latencies of the kernel
                 directly modifying the existent kernel code. This
                 article aims at providing a survey of the
                 state-of-the-art approaches for building real-time
                 Linux-based systems, with a focus on PREEMPT_RT, its
                 evolution, and the challenges that should be addressed
                 in order to move PREEMPT_RT one step ahead. Finally, we
                 present some applications and use cases that have
                 already benefited from the introduction of this
                 patch.",

  abstract =     "Atomic context is an execution state of the Linux
                 kernel in which kernel code monopolizes a CPU core. In
                 this state, the Linux kernel may only perform
                 operations that cannot sleep, as otherwise a system
                 hang or crash may occur. We refer to this kind of
                 concurrency bug as a sleep-in-atomic-context (SAC) bug.
                 In practice, SAC bugs are hard to find, as they do not
                 cause problems in all executions.\par

                 In this article, we propose a practical static approach
                 named DSAC to effectively detect SAC bugs in the Linux
                 kernel. DSAC uses three key techniques: (1) a
                 summary-based analysis to identify the code that may be
                 executed in atomic context, (2) a connection-based
                 alias analysis to identify the set of functions
                 referenced by a function pointer, and (3) a path-check
                 method to filter out repeated reports and false bugs.
                 We evaluate DSAC on Linux 4.17 and find 1,159 SAC bugs.
                 We manually check all the bugs and find that 1,068 bugs
                 are real. We have randomly selected 300 of the real
                 bugs and sent them to kernel developers. 220 of these
                 bugs have been confirmed, and 51 of our patches fixing
                 115 bugs have been applied.",

  abstract =     "Concurrency in the Linux kernel can be a contentious
                 topic. The Linux kernel mailing list features numerous
                 discussions related to consistency models, including
                 those of the more than 30 CPU architectures supported
                 by the kernel and that of the kernel itself. How are
                 Linux programs supposed to behave? Do they behave
                 correctly on exotic hardware? A formal model can help
                 address such questions. Better yet, an executable model
                 allows programmers to experiment with the model to
                 develop their intuition. Thus we offer a model written
                 in the cat language, making it not only formal, but
                 also executable by the herd simulator. We tested our
                 model against hardware and refined it in consultation
                 with maintainers. Finally, we formalised the
                 fundamental law of the Read-Copy-Update synchronisation
                 mechanism, and proved that one of its implementations
                 satisfies this law.",
