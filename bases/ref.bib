  abstract =     "Concurrency in the Linux kernel can be a contentious
                 topic. The Linux kernel mailing list features numerous
                 discussions related to consistency models, including
                 those of the more than 30 CPU architectures supported
                 by the kernel and that of the kernel itself. How are
                 Linux programs supposed to behave? Do they behave
                 correctly on exotic hardware? A formal model can help
                 address such questions. Better yet, an executable model
                 allows programmers to experiment with the model to
                 develop their intuition. Thus we offer a model written
                 in the cat language, making it not only formal, but
                 also executable by the herd simulator. We tested our
                 model against hardware and refined it in consultation
                 with maintainers. Finally, we formalised the
                 fundamental law of the Read-Copy-Update synchronisation
                 mechanism, and proved that one of its implementations
                 satisfies this law.",
